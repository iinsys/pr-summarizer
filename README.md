```yaml
name: PR Summarizer

  pull_request:
    types: [opened, synchronize, reopened]

permissions:
  pull-requests: write  # Required to comment on PRs
  issues: write        # Required for PR comments via issues API

jobs:
  summarize:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout repository
        uses: actions/checkout@v4
        with:
          fetch-depth: 0  # Ensures full history for diff analysis

      - name: Run PR Summarizer
        uses: bansikah22/pr-summarizer@v1.0.0  # Uses the lastest actions tag
        with:
          github_token: ${{ secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN }}
```

You can also visit test repositories [Test PR Summarizer](https://github.com/bansikah22/test-pr-summarizer) so see how it works on external repositories.

## How It Works

1. When a pull request is opened or updated, the action is triggered
2. It analyzes the changes made in the PR
3. It generates a concise summary of the changes
4. It fetches a programming joke from several APIs
5. It posts a comment on the PR with the summary and joke

## Development

### Prerequisites

- Rust 1.83.+
- Cargo

### Building

```bash
cargo build --release
```
